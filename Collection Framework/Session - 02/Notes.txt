Characteristics of CF :
=======================

1) Element : an object that is stored inside a collection is called element s1 s2 s3 s4 objects in collection/array object are called elements.

2) Entry: The (key,value) pair in a Map is called an entry 
    sno:101, sname:SK, course:CJ are entries

3) Homogeneous objects: Same class objects are called homogenous objects s1 s2 s3 objects of Student class are homogeneous objects.

4) Heterogeneous objects : Different class objects are called Heterogeneous objects s1 e1 acc1 objects of Student,Employee, BankAccount classes are Heterogeneous objects.

5) Duplicate: Same class object with same data are called duplicate objects.

    Student s1 = new Student(101,"SK");
    Student s2 = new Student(101,"SK");
    are duplicated objects,their data is same.

6) Unique objects: Same class objects with different data are called unique objects.
    Student s3 = new Student(102,"VK");
    Student s4 = new Student(103,"PK");
    are unique objects, these objects data is different.

Different class objects are also considered as unique objects 
        Student s1 = new Student(101,"SK");
        Employee e1 = new Employee(101,"SK");
    these two objects are diff class objects, so these objects are unique.


7) Capacity : the number of objects can be stored in a collection is called Capacity.

8) Initial Capacity : the Capacity with which this collection is created initially is called initial Capacity.

    new ArrayList(); -> initial Capacity is 10, means it is created with 10 locations to store 10 objects 

    new ArrayList(20); -> initial Capacity is 20, means it is created with 10 locations to store 20 objects


9) Incremental Capacity : When collection is filled, how much capacity it must grow is called Incremental Capacity 

    new ArrayList(); initial capacity=10, Incremental capacity=half, new capacity=15

    new ArrayList(20); initial capacity=20, Incremental capacity=half, new capacity=30
    
    new ArrayList(0); initial capacity=0, Incremental capacity=1, new capacity=1

    If Initial capacity=0/1 then => Incremental capacity+1

10) size: the number of objects/elements stored in this collection is called size.
    new ArrayList(); capacity:10 size:0 

    ArrayList al = new ArrayList();
    al.add(10);
    al.add(20);
    al.add(30);
            Capacity: 10
            size: 3

    ArrayList al = new ArrayList(3); initial Capacity:3 size:0
    al.add(10);
    al.add(20);
    al.add(30);
    al.add(40);
            new Capacity: 4 (oldCap+oldCap/2)
            size: 4           
    al.add(50);
            new Capacity: 6 (oldCap+oldCap/2)
            size: 5

    al.add("a");
            capacity:6
            size:6

    al.add("B");
            capacity:9
            size:7
