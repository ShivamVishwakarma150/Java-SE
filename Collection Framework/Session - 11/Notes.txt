# Very Important Points about ListItearator

• ListIterator in Java provides an add(E e) method which
is not there in Iterator. The method add(E e) inserts the
specified element into the list (optional operation).

• The element is inserted immediately before the
element that would be returned by next(), if any, and after
the element that would be returned by previous(), if any.

• ListItearator also provides a method called set(E e)
which replaces the last element returned by next() or
previous() with the specified element (optional
operation).

• But, this call can be made only if neither remove() nor
add(E) have been called after the last call to next() or
previous().

• ListItearator is fail-fast and throws a
ConcurrentModificationException if the underlying
collection is structurally modified in any way except
through the iterator's own remove() or add() methods.#
