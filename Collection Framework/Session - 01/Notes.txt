Need Of Collection Framework ?
===============================

Problems with Array
-------------------
1) type problem -> it can store only same type of object.

2) size problem -> you have to define size before use it 

3) it doesn't have inbuilt method.

4) It cannot store object in another formate.

5) It cannot store object in different order.
    it follows insertion order.
    it doesn't support any data structure.
