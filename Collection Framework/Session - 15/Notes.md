# **The `Set` Interface:**
The `java.util.Set` interface is a subtype of the `java.util.Collection` interface. It represents a collection of elements that prohibits duplicate objects and does not preserve the insertion order. In other words, a Set cannot contain duplicate elements, and it does not guarantee the order in which the elements were added.

**Implementation Classes of Set Interface:**
The Java platform provides three general-purpose implementations of the Set interface: HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet.

**a. HashSet:**
HashSet stores its elements in a HashMap, which internally uses a hash table data structure. It is the best-performing implementation among the three. However, it does not make any guarantees about the order in which the elements will be iterated over. This means that the elements in a HashSet may be returned in a different order than the order in which they were added.

**b. TreeSet:**
TreeSet stores its elements in a balanced binary search tree (BST). It orders the elements based on their values. Unlike HashSet, TreeSet guarantees a specific order of iteration. The elements in a TreeSet will be returned in sorted (ascending) order. However, due to the additional overhead of maintaining the sorted structure, TreeSet operations tend to be slower than HashSet.

**c. LinkedHashSet:**
LinkedHashSet is implemented as a combination of a HashMap and a linked list. It maintains a linked list running through the elements in the set, preserving the insertion order. When elements are iterated over, they are returned in the same order in which they were added to the set. LinkedHashSet provides a compromise between the performance of HashSet and the ordered iteration of TreeSet.

These implementation classes offer different trade-offs in terms of performance and iteration order. You can choose the appropriate implementation based on your specific requirements.

# **The "`HashSet`" class:**

The HashSet class is an implementation of the Set interface. It provides a collection that does not allow duplicate elements and does not preserve the insertion order of elements. Instead, elements are inserted into a HashSet based on their hashcode.

**HashSet Characteristics:**
- HashSet does not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add an element that already exists in the set, it will not be added.
- HashSet does not preserve the order in which elements are inserted. The elements are arranged based on their hashcodes, which means the iteration order may not match the insertion order.
- HashSet allows the storage of heterogeneous objects, meaning you can store objects of different types within the same set.

**Additional Features of HashSet:**
- HashSet permits the inclusion of null elements. You can add null as an element to a HashSet.
- HashSet implements the Serializable and Cloneable interfaces. This allows you to serialize and deserialize HashSet objects and create copies of HashSet instances.
- HashSet has excellent performance in searching for elements. It leverages the hashcode of each element to quickly locate and retrieve items from the set.

**Constructors of HashSet:**

1. `public HashSet()`: This constructor builds an empty HashSet with an initial capacity of 16 and a fill ratio (load factor) of 0.75. The capacity represents the number of buckets that the internal hash table can hold, and the fill ratio determines when the HashSet should be resized to accommodate more elements efficiently.

2. `public HashSet(int capacity)`: This constructor constructs an empty HashSet with the specified initial capacity and a fill ratio of 0.75. The initial capacity defines the number of buckets in the internal hash table.

3. `public HashSet(int capacity, float fillRatio)`: This constructor constructs an empty HashSet with the specified initial capacity and the specified fill ratio. The initial capacity determines the number of buckets in the internal hash table, and the fill ratio represents the load factor.

4. `public HashSet(Collection c)`: This constructor constructs a HashSet containing the elements of the specified collection. The elements are added to the HashSet in the order they are returned by the collection's iterator. Any duplicate elements are removed during the construction of the HashSet.

These constructors provide flexibility in creating HashSet instances with different initial capacities, fill ratios, and by initializing them with elements from other collections.

**Features of HashSet:**

1. **Uniqueness of Elements:** HashSet does not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add an element that already exists in the set, it will not be added. This property is achieved by internally using the hash codes of elements to determine uniqueness.

2. **No Insertion Order:** HashSet does not preserve the order in which elements are inserted. The elements are arranged based on their hash codes, which means the iteration order may not match the insertion order. If you need to maintain the order of insertion, you can consider using the LinkedHashSet class instead.

3. **Heterogeneous Objects:** HashSet allows the storage of heterogeneous objects, which means you can store objects of different types within the same set. This makes HashSet a versatile choice when you need to work with a collection of various objects.

4. **Null Elements:** HashSet permits the inclusion of null elements. You can add null as an element to a HashSet. However, please note that if you try to add multiple null elements, only one null element will be present in the set since duplicate elements are not allowed.

5. **High Performance in Searching:** HashSet offers excellent performance in searching for elements. It leverages the hash codes of elements and the underlying hash table data structure to quickly locate and retrieve items from the set. As a result, HashSet provides constant-time performance (O(1)) for basic operations like add, remove, and contains.

6. **Implementation of Interfaces:** HashSet implements the Serializable and Cloneable interfaces. Serialization allows you to convert HashSet instances into a byte stream for storage or transmission, and deserialization allows you to reconstruct HashSet objects from a byte stream. The Cloneable interface enables the creation of a copy of a HashSet using the `clone()` method.

Overall, HashSet is a versatile and efficient implementation of the Set interface in Java. It provides fast element retrieval, allows heterogeneous objects, and ensures uniqueness of elements.

# Examples code snippet

**Code Snippet 1:**
```java
import java.util.*;

class HashSetDemo1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<String> hs = new HashSet<>();
        System.out.println(hs.add("A")); // true
        System.out.println(hs.add("B")); // true
        System.out.println(hs.add("C")); // true
        System.out.println(hs.add("D")); // true
        System.out.println(hs.add("C")); // false
        System.out.println(hs.add(null)); // true
        System.out.println(hs);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
In this code snippet, a HashSet named `hs` is created to store String objects. The elements "A," "B," "C," "D," and null are added to the set using the `add()` method. The `add()` method returns `true` if the element was added successfully and `false` if the element already exists in the set. Finally, the contents of the HashSet `hs` are printed, showing the elements in an unordered manner.

**Output:**
```
true
true
true
true
false
true
[null, D, A, B, C]
```

**Code Snippet 2:**
```java
import java.util.*;

class HashSetDemo1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<String> hs = new HashSet<>();
        System.out.println(hs.add("A")); // true
        System.out.println(hs.add("B")); // true
        System.out.println(hs.add("C")); // true
        System.out.println(hs.add("D")); // true
        System.out.println(hs.add("C")); // false
        System.out.println(hs.add(null)); // true
        System.out.println(hs);
        Iterator<String> it = hs.iterator();
        while (it.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(it.next());
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
This code snippet is an extension of the previous one. After printing the contents of the HashSet, it creates an iterator named `it` using the `iterator()` method of the HashSet. The iterator allows us to traverse the elements of the HashSet. The `hasNext()` method checks if there is another element, and `next()` returns the next element in the iteration. The elements are then printed using a while loop.

**Output:**
```
true
true
true
true
false
true
[null, D, A, B, C]
null
D
A
B
C
```

Overall, these code snippets demonstrate how to create a HashSet, add elements to it, print its contents, and traverse the elements using an iterator.

# **The "`LinkedHashSet`" class:**
The LinkedHashSet class is an implementation of the Set interface and extends the HashSet class. It maintains a linked list of the entries in the set, preserving the order in which elements were inserted. This means that the insertion order of elements is maintained, unlike HashSet which does not guarantee any specific order.

**LinkedHashSet Characteristics:**
- LinkedHashSet does not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add an element that already exists in the set, it will not be added.
- LinkedHashSet allows the storage of heterogeneous objects, meaning you can store objects of different types within the same set.
- LinkedHashSet permits the inclusion of null elements. You can add null as an element to a LinkedHashSet.

**Additional Features of LinkedHashSet:**
- LinkedHashSet implements the Serializable and Cloneable interfaces. This allows you to serialize and deserialize LinkedHashSet objects and create copies of LinkedHashSet instances.
- LinkedHashSet is more suitable in scenarios where maintaining the insertion order of elements is important, similar to a List, without compromising performance.

**Constructors of LinkedHashSet:**

1. `public LinkedHashSet()`: This constructor builds an empty LinkedHashSet with an initial capacity of 16 and a fill ratio (load factor) of 0.75. The capacity represents the number of buckets that the internal hash table can hold, and the fill ratio determines when the LinkedHashSet should be resized to accommodate more elements efficiently.

2. `public LinkedHashSet(int capacity)`: This constructor constructs an empty LinkedHashSet with the specified initial capacity and a fill ratio of 0.75. The initial capacity defines the number of buckets in the internal hash table.

3. `public LinkedHashSet(int capacity, float fillRatio)`: This constructor constructs an empty LinkedHashSet with the specified initial capacity and the specified fill ratio. The initial capacity determines the number of buckets in the internal hash table, and the fill ratio represents the load factor.

4. `public LinkedHashSet(Collection c)`: This constructor constructs a LinkedHashSet containing the elements of the specified collection. The elements are added to the LinkedHashSet in the order they are returned by the collection's iterator. Any duplicate elements are removed during the construction of the LinkedHashSet.

These constructors provide flexibility in creating LinkedHashSet instances with different initial capacities, fill ratios, and by initializing them with elements from other collections.

# Example Code

**Code Snippet 1:**
```java
import java.util.*;

class LinkedHashSetDemo1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<String> lhs = new LinkedHashSet<>();
        System.out.println(lhs.add("A")); // true
        System.out.println(lhs.add("B")); // true
        System.out.println(lhs.add("C")); // true
        System.out.println(lhs.add("D")); // true
        System.out.println(lhs.add("C")); // false
        System.out.println(lhs.add(null)); // true
        System.out.println(lhs);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
In this code snippet, a LinkedHashSet named `lhs` is created to store String objects. The elements "A," "B," "C," "D," and null are added to the set using the `add()` method. The `add()` method returns `true` if the element was added successfully and `false` if the element already exists in the set. Finally, the contents of the LinkedHashSet `lhs` are printed, showing the elements in the order of insertion.

**Output:**
```
true
true
true
true
false
true
[A, B, C, D, null]
```

**Code Snippet 2:**
```java
import java.util.*;

class LinkedHashSetDemo1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<String> lhs = new LinkedHashSet<>();
        System.out.println(lhs.add("A")); // true
        System.out.println(lhs.add("B")); // true
        System.out.println(lhs.add("C")); // true
        System.out.println(lhs.add("D")); // true
        System.out.println(lhs.add("C")); // false
        System.out.println(lhs.add(null)); // true
        System.out.println(lhs);
        Iterator<String> it = lhs.iterator();
        while (it.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(it.next());
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
This code snippet is an extension of the previous one. After printing the contents of the LinkedHashSet, it creates an iterator named `it` using the `iterator()` method of the LinkedHashSet. The iterator allows us to traverse the elements of the LinkedHashSet. The `hasNext()` method checks if there is another element, and `next()` returns the next element in the iteration. The elements are then printed using a while loop.

**Output:**
```
true
true
true
true
false
true
[A, B, C, D, null]
A
B
C
D
null
```

Overall, these code snippets demonstrate how to create a LinkedHashSet, add elements to it, print its contents, and traverse the elements using an iterator. The order of insertion is preserved in a LinkedHashSet, making it suitable when maintaining insertion order is important.

# Featrues of LinkedHashSet

1. **Maintains Insertion Order:** LinkedHashSet maintains the order in which elements were inserted into the set. This means that when you iterate over the LinkedHashSet, the elements will be returned in the same order in which they were added.

2. **No Duplicate Elements:** LinkedHashSet does not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add an element that already exists in the set, it will not be added.

3. **Heterogeneous Objects:** LinkedHashSet allows the storage of heterogeneous objects, meaning you can store objects of different types within the same set.

4. **Permits Null Elements:** LinkedHashSet permits the inclusion of null elements. You can add null as an element to a LinkedHashSet.

5. **Implements Set Interface:** LinkedHashSet is an implementation of the Set interface, providing all the operations and behavior defined by the Set interface. This includes methods like add, remove, contains, and size.

6. **Combines HashSet and LinkedList:** LinkedHashSet is implemented as a combination of a hash table (HashSet) and a linked list. The hash table provides fast lookup and retrieval, while the linked list maintains the order of insertion.

7. **Good Performance in Search Operations:** LinkedHashSet provides good performance in search operations. It utilizes the underlying hash table to quickly locate and retrieve elements, resulting in constant-time complexity (O(1)) for add, remove, and contains operations.

8. **Implements Serializable and Cloneable:** LinkedHashSet implements the Serializable and Cloneable interfaces. This allows you to serialize and deserialize LinkedHashSet objects and create copies of LinkedHashSet instances.

LinkedHashSet offers the benefits of maintaining insertion order while providing efficient search operations, making it suitable for scenarios where both ordering and performance are important.

# **The "`SortedSet`" interface:**
The SortedSet interface is a subtype of the Set interface in Java. It extends the functionality of a Set by providing a sorted collection of elements. It ensures that the elements are ordered according to their natural ordering or a specified Comparator provided at the time of creating the sorted set.

**SortedSet specific methods:**

**1. `public Object first()`:**
This method returns the first (lowest) element currently in the sorted set. It throws a `NoSuchElementException` if the set is empty.

```java
SortedSet<Integer> sortedSet = new TreeSet<>();
sortedSet.add(3);
sortedSet.add(1);
sortedSet.add(2);
System.out.println(sortedSet.first()); // Output: 1
```

Explanation: In this example, we create a `TreeSet` and add three elements: 3, 1, and 2. The `first()` method is then called on the sorted set, which returns the first element (i.e., the lowest element) in the set, which is 1.

**2. `public Object last()`:**
This method returns the last (highest) element currently in the sorted set. It throws a `NoSuchElementException` if the set is empty.

```java
SortedSet<Integer> sortedSet = new TreeSet<>();
sortedSet.add(3);
sortedSet.add(1);
sortedSet.add(2);
System.out.println(sortedSet.last()); // Output: 3
```

Explanation: In this example, we create a `TreeSet` and add three elements: 3, 1, and 2. The `last()` method is called on the sorted set, which returns the last element (i.e., the highest element) in the set, which is 3.

**3. `public SortedSet headSet(Object toElement)`:**
This method returns a view of the portion of the sorted set whose elements are strictly less than the specified `toElement`. The returned set is backed by the original set and supports all optional set operations.

```java
SortedSet<Integer> sortedSet = new TreeSet<>();
sortedSet.add(3);
sortedSet.add(1);
sortedSet.add(2);
SortedSet<Integer> headSet = sortedSet.headSet(3);
System.out.println(headSet); // Output: [1, 2]
```

Explanation: In this example, we create a `TreeSet` and add three elements: 3, 1, and 2. The `headSet(3)` method is called on the sorted set, which returns a new sorted set containing all elements strictly less than 3. The resulting `headSet` contains elements 1 and 2.

**4. `public SortedSet tailSet(Object fromElement)`:**
This method returns a view of the portion of the sorted set whose elements are greater than or equal to the specified `fromElement`. The returned set is backed by the original set and supports all optional set operations.

```java
SortedSet<Integer> sortedSet = new TreeSet<>();
sortedSet.add(3);
sortedSet.add(1);
sortedSet.add(2);
SortedSet<Integer> tailSet = sortedSet.tailSet(2);
System.out.println(tailSet); // Output: [2, 3]
```

Explanation: In this example, we create a `TreeSet` and add three elements: 3, 1, and 2. The `tailSet(2)` method is called on the sorted set, which returns a new sorted set containing all elements greater than or equal to 2. The resulting `tailSet` contains elements 2 and 3.

**5. `public SortedSet subSet(Object fromElement, Object toElement)`:**
This method returns a view of the portion of the sorted set whose elements range from `fromElement` (inclusive) to `toElement` (exclusive). The returned set is backed by the original set and supports all optional set operations.

```java
SortedSet<Integer> sortedSet = new TreeSet<>();
sortedSet.add(3);
sortedSet.add(1);
sortedSet.add(2);
SortedSet<Integer> subSet = sortedSet.subSet(1, 3);
System.out.println(subSet); // Output: [1, 2]
```

Explanation: In this example, we create a `TreeSet` and add three elements: 3, 1, and 2. The `subSet(1, 3)` method is called on the sorted set, which returns a new sorted set containing all elements from 1 (inclusive) to 3 (exclusive). The resulting `subSet` contains elements 1 and 2.

**6. `public Comparator comparator()`:**
This method returns the `Comparator` used to order the elements in the sorted set. If the sorted set uses the natural ordering of its elements, it returns `null`.

```java
SortedSet<String> sortedSet = new TreeSet<>();
System.out.println(sortedSet.comparator()); // Output: null

SortedSet<Integer> customSortedSet = new TreeSet<>(Comparator.reverseOrder());
System.out.println(customSortedSet.comparator()); // Output: java.util.Collections$ReverseComparator@2d98a335
```

Explanation: In the first example, a `TreeSet` of Strings is created, and the `comparator()` method is called, which returns `null` since it uses the natural ordering of Strings. In the second example, a `TreeSet` of Integers is created with a custom reverse ordering using `Comparator.reverseOrder()`, and the `comparator()` method is called, returning the Comparator instance used for reverse ordering.
