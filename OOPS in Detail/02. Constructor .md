**CONSTRUCTOR**

In Java, constructors are special methods of a class that have the following important features:

1. The name of the constructor is exactly the same as the name of the class.
2. Constructors do not have any return type, not even void.
3. Constructors are automatically called by Java as soon as an object of the class is created. Object creation is done using the "new" keyword, and the constructor is called implicitly.
4. If the return type of a constructor is mentioned, Java treats it as a normal instance method and will not call it on object creation.
5. If a programmer does not define any constructor of their own, Java automatically inserts a default constructor in the class. The default constructor has no arguments and performs no specific operations.
6. Unlike C++, Java does not provide a default copy constructor.

**Example 1: Default Constructor**

```java
class Student {
    private int roll;
    private String name;
    private double per;

    public Student() {
        System.out.println("Constructor called...");
    }

    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Roll=" + roll + ", Name=" + name + ", Per=" + per);
    }
}

class UseStudent {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student obj = new Student();
        obj.show();
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a class "Student" with private instance variables "roll," "name," and "per." We also define a default constructor `public Student()` which gets called automatically when a new object of the "Student" class is created using `new Student()`. In the `main` method of the "UseStudent" class, we create an object of "Student" and call its `show()` method.

**Example 2: Parameterized Constructor**

```java
class Account {
    private int accId;
    private String name;
    private double bal;

    public Account(int id, String str, double amt) {
        accId = id;
        name = str;
        bal = amt;
    }

    public void show() {
        System.out.println("acctid=" + accId + ", Name=" + name + ", Bal=" + bal);
    }
}

class UseAccount {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Account obj1 = new Account(101, "Amit", 75000.0);
        Account obj2 = new Account(102, "Sumit", 80000.0);

        obj1.show();
        obj2.show();
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a class "Account" with private instance variables "accId," "name," and "bal." We also define a parameterized constructor `public Account(int id, String str, double amt)` that accepts three arguments and initializes the instance variables with the provided values. In the `main` method of the "UseAccount" class, we create two objects of "Account" using the parameterized constructor and call their `show()` method.

**Example 3: Using User Input**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class Account {
    private int accId;
    private String name;
    private double bal;

    public Account(int id, String str, double amt) {
        accId = id;
        name = str;
        bal = amt;
    }

    public void show() {
        System.out.println("acctid=" + accId + ", Name=" + name + ", Bal=" + bal);
    }
}

class UseAccount {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter accid, name,

 and bal:");
        int id = sc.nextInt();
        String str = sc.next();
        double amt = sc.nextDouble();
        Account obj1 = new Account(id, str, amt);

        obj1.show();
        sc.close();
    }
}
```

In this example, we use the `Scanner` class to accept user input for the account details. The user is prompted to enter the account ID, name, and balance. We create an object of the "Account" class using the parameterized constructor, passing the user-provided values. Finally, we call the `show()` method to display the account details.

**Example 4: Array of Objects**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class Account {
    private int accId;
    private String name;
    private double bal;

    public Account(int id, String str, double amt) {
        accId = id;
        name = str;
        bal = amt;
    }

    public void show() {
        System.out.println("acctid=" + accId + ", Name=" + name + ", Bal=" + bal);
    }
}

class UseAccount {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Account[] A = new Account[2];
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
            System.out.println("Enter accid, name, and bal:");
            int id = sc.nextInt();
            String str = sc.next();
            double amt = sc.nextDouble();
            A[i] = new Account(id, str, amt);
        }

        for (Account x : A) {
            x.show();
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an array of "Account" objects. Inside a loop, we prompt the user to enter the account details and create new objects of the "Account" class using the parameterized constructor. The objects are stored in the array. Finally, we iterate over the array and call the `show()` method for each object to display the account details.

These examples demonstrate the use of constructors in Java, including default constructors, parameterized constructors, and their usage with user input and arrays of objects.

## Interview questions related to constructors in Java, along with their answers and code examples:

1. **Question:** What is a constructor in Java?
   **Answer:** A constructor is a special method in a class that is used to initialize objects of that class. It has the same name as the class and is invoked using the `new` keyword.

2. **Question:** Can a class have multiple constructors?
   **Answer:** Yes, a class can have multiple constructors. This is known as constructor overloading.

3. **Question:** What is the default constructor?
   **Answer:** The default constructor is a constructor that is automatically provided by the Java compiler if no explicit constructor is defined. It initializes the object with default values.

4. **Question:** How is a constructor different from a method?
   **Answer:** Constructors are used for object initialization and have the same name as the class, while methods perform operations on objects and have different names.

5. **Question:** Can a constructor be private?
   **Answer:** Yes, a constructor can be private. This is often used in singleton classes to prevent direct instantiation of objects.

6. **Question:** Can a constructor be inherited?
   **Answer:** Constructors are not inherited in Java. However, a subclass can call the constructor of its superclass using the `super()` keyword.

7. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `this()` constructor call?
   **Answer:** The `this()` constructor call is used to invoke another constructor in the same class. It is commonly used to avoid code duplication in constructors with different parameter lists.

8. **Question:** Can a constructor call a non-static method?
   **Answer:** Yes, a constructor can call non-static methods.

9. **Question:** Can a constructor call another constructor of the same class?
   **Answer:** Yes, a constructor can call another constructor of the same class using the `this()` constructor call.

10. **Question:** What happens if a class does not have a constructor?
    **Answer:** If a class does not have any constructors defined, the Java compiler automatically adds a default constructor.

11. **Question:** What is the purpose of a parameterized constructor?
    **Answer:** A parameterized constructor allows the initialization of object properties with values passed as arguments during object creation.

12. **Question:** Can constructors be overridden in Java?
    **Answer:** Constructors cannot be overridden in Java. However, a subclass can call the constructor of its superclass using the `super()` keyword.

13. **Question:** What is constructor chaining?
    **Answer:** Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another using the `this()` or `super()` constructor call.

14. **Question:** What is the order of constructor execution in a class hierarchy?
    **Answer:** The constructor execution order starts from the topmost superclass and follows down to the subclass.

15. **Question:** Can a constructor be final?
    **Answer:** No, constructors cannot be declared as `final` in Java.

16. **Question:** Can a constructor be static?
    **Answer:** No, constructors cannot be declared as `static` in Java.

17. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `super()` constructor call?
    **Answer:** The `super()` constructor call is used to invoke the constructor of the superclass. It is used to initialize the inherited members of the subclass.

18. **Question:** How do you create an object without invoking a constructor?
    **Answer:** It is not possible to create an object without invoking a constructor in Java.

19. **Question:** Can a constructor have a return type?
    **Answer:** No, constructors do not have a return type, not even `void`. They are

 responsible for initializing the object and cannot return a value.

20. **Question:** What is the difference between `new` and calling a constructor?
    **Answer:** The `new` keyword is used to create an object by calling a constructor. The constructor initializes the object, while `new` allocates memory for the object.

Here's an example demonstrating some of the concepts discussed:

```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    // Default constructor
    public Person() {
        this.name = "Unknown";
        this.age = 0;
    }
    
    // Parameterized constructor
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person1 = new Person(); // Using default constructor
        person1.displayInfo();
        
        Person person2 = new Person("John", 25); // Using parameterized constructor
        person2.displayInfo();
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Name: Unknown
Age: 0
Name: John
Age: 25
```

These are just a few examples of questions related to constructors in Java. Depending on the interview, the depth of questions may vary. It's always a good practice to study and understand the core concepts thoroughly before appearing for an interview.
